This is the program file which contains the Reminderinator!
This program is for the forgetful, for those who, for some reason or another,
forget the birthdays of their friends (If you're one of those people, you'll understand this feeling.)
This program allows users to store the birthday information of other people (name, age, birthday date),
and access it at their own will. Users can also store those people's preferences, general ideas of gifts
that they can buy the individual, so that they can always be prepared and get the right gift (or at least, point them in the right direction.).
If it so happens that the user accesses the information of a person who's birthday happens to be today, they'll get a firm, but helpful reminder.
